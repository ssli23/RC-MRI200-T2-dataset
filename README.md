# RC-MRI200-T2 Dataset

The RC-MRI200-T2 dataset comprises pelvic MRI scans from 200 patients with stage T2 rectal cancer, sourced from Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, affiliated with Zhejiang University School of Medicine. The dataset features bounding box annotations around rectal cancer targets, a method that is more time-efficient and less labor-intensive compared to pixel-level segmentation.

This dataset offers a valuable resource for advancing rectal cancer research.
